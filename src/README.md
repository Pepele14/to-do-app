# TaskTrek ToDo App

TaskTrek is a simple ToDo application built using React. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks with corresponding details.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- React Router: Declarative routing for React applications
- UUID: Library for generating unique identifiers
- Font Awesome: Icon library for adding icons to the UI

## How It Works

The TaskTrek ToDo App consists of the following components:

- **Navbar**: Displays the logo of the app.
- **Sidebar**: Navigation links for navigating between Home and About pages.
- **HomePage**: Displays a list of tasks with the ability to add new tasks.
- **ToDoForm**: Form component for adding new tasks.
- **ToDoList**: Component for displaying individual tasks with options to edit and delete.
- **ItemDetails**: Displays details of a specific task when clicked.
- **Footer**: Provides a link to the GitHub repository of the project.

When the app is launched, users are greeted with the Home Page where they can add new tasks using the input form. Each task is displayed with options to edit or delete. Clicking on a task reveals its details on a separate page. Users can navigate between pages using the sidebar links.
